### Walls

A wall is like a group where you can invite other people (they also need to have a Spotify account).

On the dashboard you will see each wall you've joined.
You can create a new wall by using the `+` card.

The wall will show what each member is currently listening to.

### Manage Members

The creator of the wall can invite people with a per-wall invitation link.

If for whatever reason you want prevent people with the invitation link from joining, the owner of the wall can generate a new invitation link.

### Disable Sharing for a given Wall

You can always stop sharing to a wall without actually leaving the wall by using the `Stop Sharing` feature.

To start sharing again the `Start Sharing` feature can be used.

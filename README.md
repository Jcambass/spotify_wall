# SpotifyWall

Spotify Wall is a small side project mine which allows you to create groups (Walls) for you and your friends or coworkers in order to share the current song youâ€™re listing to on spotify.

## How it works


### Signup
Using spotifywall is easy. You sign up with your Spotify account.
### Walls

A wall is like a group where you can invite other people (they also need to have a Spotify account).

The wall will show what each member is currently listening to.

BILD

The creator of the wall can invite people with a per-wall invitation link.

BILD

He also has the ability to remove people from the wall.

BILD

If for whatever reason you want prevent people with the invitation link from joining, the owner of the wall can generate a new invitation link.

BILD

### Sharing Activity

Your activity will be shared to all walls you've joined.

### Disable Sharing for a given Wall

You can always stop sharing to a wall without actually leaving the wall by using the `Stop Sharing` feature.

BILD

To start sharing again the `Start Sharing` feature can be used.

## Hosted Version

Currently a hosted, free version can be user under spotifywall.com.
I don't plan to monetize this version but I might decide to shut it down one day, hence this being opensourced.

## To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
